# module1-challenge-
An on-the-job challenge focusing on accessibility. To make the webpage more accessible I used semnatic HTML elements and alternative text (alt) for images. In the HTML document I changed many of the elements, and the order to be in either a sequential order or a more logial order. 
The title of the page was changed from for clarity.
